# Contributing to Neo Zig SDK

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Neo Zig SDK! This guide will help you get started with contributing to this enterprise-grade blockchain SDK.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Neo Zig SDK is a complete, production-ready implementation of a Neo blockchain SDK in Zig, providing:
- Complete Swift SDK API compatibility
- Enterprise-grade security with memory safety
- Superior performance with optimized algorithms
- Comprehensive Neo blockchain functionality

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Zig 0.12.0+](https://ziglang.org/download/)
- Git
- Basic understanding of Neo blockchain
- Familiarity with Zig programming language

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:r3e-network/NeoZig.git
   cd NeoZig
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   zig build
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   zig build test
   ```

4. **Run examples**
   ```bash
   zig build examples
   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow standard Zig formatting (`zig fmt`)
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add comprehensive documentation comments for public APIs
- Ensure memory safety with explicit allocator management
- Validate all inputs and handle errors explicitly

### Security Requirements

- **Never expose private keys** in logs or error messages
- **Validate all inputs** from external sources
- **Use secure random** for all cryptographic operations
- **Implement constant-time** operations for sensitive data
- **Clear sensitive data** from memory after use

### Performance Guidelines

- **Minimize allocations** in hot paths
- **Use stack allocation** for fixed-size data
- **Implement zero-copy** operations where possible
- **Profile critical paths** and optimize bottlenecks
- **Benchmark new features** against performance targets

## üß™ Testing

### Test Requirements

- **Add tests** for all new functionality
- **Cover edge cases** and error conditions
- **Include performance** benchmarks for critical operations
- **Validate security** implications of changes
- **Test memory safety** with leak detection

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
zig build test

# Run specific test suite
zig test src/crypto/keys.zig
zig test tests/crypto_tests.zig

# Run with summary
zig build test --summary all

# Performance benchmarks
zig build bench
```

## üìù Documentation

### Documentation Requirements

- **Document all public APIs** with clear descriptions
- **Provide usage examples** for complex functionality
- **Explain security implications** of cryptographic operations
- **Include performance characteristics** for operations
- **Update README** for significant changes

### Documentation Style

```zig
/// Generates a new cryptographically secure private key.
///
/// This function uses the OS cryptographic random number generator
/// to create a private key that is guaranteed to be in the valid
/// range for the secp256r1 curve.
///
/// ## Security
/// The generated key is cryptographically secure and suitable for
/// production use. Always zeroize the key after use.
///
/// ## Performance
/// Key generation typically takes <10ms on modern hardware.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```zig
/// const private_key = neo.crypto.generatePrivateKey();
/// defer private_key.zeroize();
/// ```
pub fn generatePrivateKey() PrivateKey {
    // Implementation...
}
```
